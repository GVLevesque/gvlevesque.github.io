Welcome to my webpage! My name is Gabriel and I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Sociology and Tomlinson Doctoral Fellow at McGill University.

I study regulatory power, the politics of science and expertise, and the social construction of risk. I use mixed methods to answer questions that often lead me to comparative-historical analysis. In my dissertation, titled <i>Structures of Latency: The Protraction of Regulatory Controversies over Toxic Substances</i>, I investigate regulatory inertia and change with a substantive focus on environmental and occupational exposures to toxics in Canada and the U.S.

My research has appeared in <i>Theory and Social Inquiry</i>, <i>Public Understanding of Science</i> and <i>Administration & Society</i>, among other venues.

If and when I’m not doing research, you can find me in a café, at a museum, or on a basketball court.

Happy to hear from you at <a href="mailto:gabriel.levesque2@mail.mcgill.ca">gabriel.levesque2@mail.mcgill.ca</a>.
